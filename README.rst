Infrastructure Anywhere
=======================

This is the version of Infrastructure Anywhere which has been used at PuppetConf 2011 Portland. For more info see: http://www.infrastructureanywhere.com for more info about the Puppet talk. Or watch the talk on youtube: http://youtu.be/cjPjiHcc5rw

Originally this was included as a seedBank addon and for now it is a collection of Fabric scripts.

Development is still going on and it the meantime it became an application instead of a collection of Fabric scripts.

The application has not been released to public yet, and will be released when it is done.

This Git repository will be overwritten with the application, when it has been released.
